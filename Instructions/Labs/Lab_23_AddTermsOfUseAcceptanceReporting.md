## Exercise 1: Establish a Terms of Use and Conduct Testing

In this exercise, you will learn how to use Microsoft Entra terms of use policies which is a simple method that organizations can use to present information to end users.

### Task 1: Add terms of use

Once you have finalized your terms of use document, use the following procedure to add it.

1. Connect to [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com).

2. Sign in using below credential.
   | Setting | Value |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | Username | **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" enableCopy="true" />** |
   | Password | **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" enableCopy="true" />** |

3. Open selectÂ **Identity Governance** in the lefthand navigation menu.
   
4. In the menu under, select **Entitlement management**.

5. To create a new term,
    - In the left navigation menu of the **Identity Governance** page, under **Terms of use**, select **Terms of use (1)**.
    - On the Terms of use page, on the top menu, select **+ New terms (2)**

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff72f667-1e82-4a0a-aca5-de00bd363c16)


6. Within the **New terms of use** page, configure the following:
    
    - **Name:** Enter **Testing terms of use (1)**. This is the terms of use that will be used in the Azure portal.
    
    - Select the **Terms of use document box (2)**, browse to your finalized terms of use PDF and select it.

       >**Note:** **ToU File Provided** - Browse to the local file path **C:\AllFiles\SC-300-Identity-and-Access-Administrator\AllFiles\Labs\Lab26\Contoso_TermsOfuse.pdf** to get a sample Terms-of-User PDF document for use in this lab.
    
    - Select **English (3)** for the language for your terms of use document.

       >**Note:** The language option allows you to upload multiple terms of use, each with a different language. The version of the terms of use that an end user will see will be based on their browser preferences.

    - In the **Display name** box, enter **Contoso Terms of Use (4)**. This is the title that users see when they sign in.
    
    - To require end users to view the terms of use prior to accepting them, set **Require users to expand the terms of use** to **On (5)**.

    - To require end users to accept your terms of use on every device they are accessing from, set **Require users to consent on every device** to **Off (6)**. Users may be required to install additional applications if this option is enabled.

       >**Note:** Consent on every device will require users to register each device with Microsoft Entra ID prior to getting access. It is a good practice to require this setting to On; however for the purpose of a cleaner lab, we are using Off.
    
    - If you want to expire terms of use consents on a schedule, set **Expire consents** to **On (7)**.

      ![](./media/lab23-3.png)

7. When **Expire consents** is set to **On**, two additional schedule settings are displayed:

    ![](./media/lab23-3-1.png)

8. Use the **Expire starting on (1)** and **Frequency (2)** settings to specify the schedule for terms of use expirations. The following table shows the result for a couple of example settings:

    | Expire starting on | Frequency | Result |
    |---|---|---|
    | Today's date | Monthly | Starting today, users must accept the terms of use and then reaccept every month.|
    | Date in the future | Monthly | Starting today, users must accept the terms of use. When the future date occurs, consents will expire and then users must reaccept every month. |

    >**Note:** For example, if you set the expire starting on date to **Jan 1** and frequency to **Monthly**, here is how expirations might occur for two users:

    | User | First accept date | First expire date | Second expire date | Third expire date |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Alice | Jan 1 | Feb 1 | Mar 1 | Apr 1|
    | Bob | Jan 15 | Feb 1 | Mar 1| Apr 1 |

     ![](./media/lab23-3-2.png)

9. Use the **Duration before re-acceptance requires (days)** setting to specify the number of days before the user must reaccept the terms of use. This allows users to follow their own schedule. For example, if you set the duration to **30** days, here is how expirations might occur for two users:

    | User | First accept date | First expire date | Second expire date | Third expire date |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Alice | Jan 1 | Jan 31 | Mar 2 | Apr 1|
    | Bob | Jan 15 | Feb 14 | Mar 16| Apr 15

    >**Note:** It is possible to use the Expire consents and Duration before re-acceptance requires (days) settings together, but typically you use one or the other.

   ![](./media/lab23-3-3.png)

10. Under **Conditional Access**, select **Custom policy (1)** and then click on **Create (2)**.

    | Template | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Access to cloud apps for all guests** | A Conditional Access policy will be created for all guests and all cloud apps. This policy impacts the Azure portal. Once this is created, you might be required to sign-out and sign-in. | 
    |**Access to cloud apps for all users** | A Conditional Access policy will be created for all users and all cloud apps. This policy impacts the Azure portal. Once this is created, you will be required to sign-out and sign-in. |
    | **Custom policy** | Select the users, groups, and apps that this terms of use will be applied to. |
    | **Create Conditional Access policy later** | This terms of use will appear in the grant control list when creating a Conditional Access policy. |

    ![](./media/lab23-3-4.png)

    >**IMPORTANT:** Conditional Access policy controls (including terms of use) do not support enforcement on service accounts. We recommend excluding all service accounts from the Conditional Access policy.

    >**Note:** Custom Conditional Access policies enable granular terms of use, down to a specific cloud application or group of users. For more information, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/require-tou](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/require-tou).

11. When the terms of use is created, you will automatically be redirected to the Conditional access policy page. On the page,
    - **Name:** Enter **Enforce ToU (1)**.
    - Under **Assignments|Users**, select **0 users and groups selected**.
    - Within the **Include** tab, ensure to choose **Select users and groups (3)** radio button.
    - Select the **Users and groups (4)** checkbox.
    - Under **Select**, click on **0 users and groups selected (5)** to add the new user who would be alligned to this conditional access policy.
    - In the Select pane, select **Alex Wilber (6)** account to use to test the terms and policy.
    - Click on **Select (7)**.

    >**Note:** Do not select the ODL_user <inject key="DeploymentId" enableCopy="false" /> which can be used to ensure that your administrator account does not get locked out.
    
    >**Warning:** If you choose your administrator account, like all conditional access policies, be sure you have another account with enough permissions to change the conditional access policy. This is to ensure your administrator account will not be locked out should the conditional access policy result in an undesirable outcome.

    ![](./media/lab23-4.png)
    ![](./media/lab23-5.png)

12. In order to implement terms of use over a specific app for the user, execute the following configurations while creating the conditional access policy:
    - Under the **Target resources** section, click on **No target resources selected (1)**.
    - Ensure to have **Resources(formerly Cloud apps) (2)** option selected from the dropdown list.
    - Within the **Include** tab, choose the **All resources (formerly All cloud apps) (3)** radio button.

       ![](./media/L23T1S12.png)

13. To provide control access enforcement to block or grant access, perform the following:
    - Under **Access controls**, select **0 controls selected (1)**.
    - In the Grant pane,
        - Select the **Grant access (2)** radio button.
        - Ensure to check the **Testing terms of use (3)** checkbox.
        - Click on **Select (4)**.
        - Under **Enable policy**, select **On (5)**.
        - When complete, select **Create (6)**.
    
         ![](./media/lab23-7.png)

         >**Note:** There may be scenarios in which you may be produced with an error message stating that the Security defaults must be disabled to enable conditional access policy. In such cases, the account being provided may have the security defaults set to enabled for MFA functionality. It is recommended to disable the security default before proceeding with this lab. Follow the below instructions:
    - Click on the **disable security defaults** from the warning that displays as shown in the below screenshot.
      
       ![](./media/lab13-ms-entra-id-10.png)
    
    - Within the Security defaults page, ensure that the option - **Disabled (1)** is selected.
    - Select a reason for disabling - **Too many sign-in multifactor authentication challenges (2)**
    - Click on **Save (3)**
