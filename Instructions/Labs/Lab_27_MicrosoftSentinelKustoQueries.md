# Lab 27 - Microsoft Sentinel Kusto Queries for Microsoft Entra ID data sources

## Lab scenario

Microsoft Sentinel is Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution.  Through connecting data sources from Microsoft and third-party security solutions, you have the ability to execute security operations tasks.  In this lab exercise, you will create a Microsoft Sentinel workspace with data connectors to Azure AD for executing hunting queries using Kusto Query Language (KQL). 

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will be performing the following tasks:

- Task 1 - Create a Microsoft Sentinel workspace
- Task 2 - Add Azure AD as a Data source
- Task 3 - Run Kusto query on User activity

1. If prompted, select **OK** to activate the Microsoft Sentinel free trial.

1. In **Microsoft Sentinel**, from the left-hand navigate menu under the **Configuration** section, select **Data connectors**.

1. Scroll down under the Getting started section Click on **Get these data connectors**. 

1. In the list of Data connectors, locate **Microsoft Entra ID** and select.

1. To the right, a preview tile will open.  Select **Install**.

1. Once installation is done, navigate back to the menu to **Configuration** and select **Data connectors (1)**

1. Click on **Refresh** to view the Microsoft Entra ID Data Connector.

   >**Note:** You can ignore the warning that appears.

1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** connector name and to the right, a preview tile will open click on **Open connector page**.

   ![Screen image displaying the Azure AD roles page with the Settings menu highlighted](./media/lab27-1.png)

1. In the connector page, the instructions and next steps will be provided for the data connector. Verify that a check-mark is next to each of the **Prerequisites** to continue with the **Configuration**.

   ![Screen image displaying the Azure AD roles page with the Settings menu highlighted](./mediasc-300-cp-4.png)

1. Under **Configuration**, check the boxes for **Sign-in logs** and **Audit logs**. Additional log sources are available but are currently in **Preview** and out of scope for this course and click on **Apply Changes**. 

   ![Screen image displaying the Azure AD roles page with the Settings menu highlighted](./media/lab27-3.png)

1. Notification will be provided that the changes were applied successfully. Navigate to the **Microsoft Sentinel** workspace by selecting the **X** on the top right of the connector page.

1. Select **Refresh** on the **Microsoft Sentinel | Data connectors** tile and the number 1 will show in the **Connected** count.

   ![Screen image displaying the Azure AD roles page with the Settings menu highlighted](./media/lab27-2.png)

    > **Note** - The Microsoft Entra ID data connector may take a few minutes to show in the active count.

    > **Note** - If the Connected count isn't displayed after a few minutes, try deleting the connector and then adding it again.

### Task 3 - Run Kusto query on User activity

1. In **Microsoft Sentinel** page, from the left-hand navigation page select **Logs** under the **General** menu section.

1. Close the **Welcome to Log Analytics** window.

1. A window will open with sample queries, select **Audit (1)**, search and scroll to find **User IDs**.

1. Select **Run (2)**.
