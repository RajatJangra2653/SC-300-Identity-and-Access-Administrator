3. Select **+ New user** to create a new user in Microsoft Entra ID.

4. On the New user menu, select **Invite external user** and then add your information as the guest user.

Also, some email providers allow users to add a plus symbol (+) and additional text to their email addresses to help with things like inbox filtering. However, Microsoft Entra ID does not currently support plus symbols in email addresses. To avoid delivery issues, omit the plus symbol and any characters following it up to the @ symbol.

5. Enter email address: **sc300externaluser1@sc300email.com**

6. Click on **Review + Invite** and subsequebtly click on **Invite**.

7. On the Users page, verify your account is listed and, in the **User type** column, verify **Guest** is shown.After you send the invitation, the user account is automatically added to the directory as a guest.

## Exercise 2 - Invite guest users in bulk

Efficiently invite multiple guest users in bulk to streamline the onboarding process for external collaborators and enhance productivity in shared digital environments.

### Task 1 - Bulk user invite

A recent partnership has been established with another company. For now, employees of the partner company will be added as guests. You need to ensure you can import multiple guest users at one time.

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.

2. Under **Manage**, select **Users**.

3. On the Users page, on the menu, select **Bulk operations > Bulk invite**.

4. In the Bulk invite users pane, select **Download** to a sample CSV template with invitation properties.

5. Using an editor to view the CSV file, review the template.

6. Open the .csv template and add a line for each guest user. Required values are:

    - **Email address to invite** - the user who will receive an invitation
    - **Redirection url** - the URL to which the invited user is forwarded after accepting the invitation.

    >**Note:** Sign in with the ODL user credentials present in the Environment Details page in order to be able to edit the excel sheet.
    
    >**Note:** You can use any email address and redirection URL

7. Save the file.

8. On the Bulk invite users page, under **Upload your csv file**, browse to the file.

     >**Note** - When you select the file, validation of the .csv file starts.

9. After the file contents are validated, you will see **File uploaded successfully**. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can submit the job.

10. When your file passes validation, select **Submit** to start the Azure bulk operation that adds the invitations.

11. To view the job status, select **Select here to view the status of each operation**. Or, you can select **Bulk operation results** in the Activity section. For details about each line item within the bulk operation, select the values under the **# Success**, **# Failure**, or **Total Requests** columns. If failures occurred, the reasons for failure will be listed.

12. When the job completes, you will see a notification that the bulk operation succeeded.

### Task 2 - Invite guest users with PowerShell

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator. This can be done by searching for PowerShell in Windows and choosing Run as administrator. 

1. You will need to Install the Microsoft.Graph PowerShell module if you have not used it before. Run the following two commands and when prompted to confirm press Y:

    ```
    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
    ```
    >**Note:** - It might take some time for it to run.

1. Confirm the Microsoft.Graph module is installed:
   
    ```
    Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph
    ```
    
1. Next, you will need to login to Azure by running:
   
    ```
    Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite.All"
    ```
     
    The Edge browser will open and you will be prompted to sign-in.  Use the ODL user account to connect.  Accept the permissions request; then close the browser window.

    >**Note**: In the pop-up that appears click on **Yes**.
    
1. Set the values for the email and redirect for the External user:
   
    ```
    Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Identity.SignIns
    
    $params = @{
	    invitedUserEmailAddress = "admin@fabrikam.com"
	    inviteRedirectUrl = "https://myapp.contoso.com"
    }
    ```
1. Send the MgInvitation command to invite the External user:

   ```
    New-MgInvitation -BodyParameter $params
    ```
1. You can close PowerShell at this point.
    
You now know how to invite users within the Microsoft Entra admin center, Microsoft 365 Admin center, Bulk invitations with a csv file, and inviting users with PowerShell commands.  You can go into the Microsoft Entra admin center, and check All Users to see that ADMIN has been added as an external suer.
