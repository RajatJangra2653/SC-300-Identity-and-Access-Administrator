Based on your organizational requirements, you can customize the Microsoft Entra ID smart lockout values. Customization of the smart lockout settings, with values specific to your organization, requires Microsoft Entra ID Premium P1 or higher licenses for your users. For the ease of lab accessibility, this laboratory scenario is provided with an active Microsoft Entra ID P1 license.

   >**Note:** When the smart lockout threshold is triggered, you will get the following message while the account is locked:
    - Your account is temporarily locked to prevent unauthorized use. Try again later, and if you still have trouble, contact your admin.

1. This can be tested by using your Entra ID credentials, Open a private browser and navigate to <login.microsoftonline.com> and enter an incorrect password until the account gets notification that it is locked out.
