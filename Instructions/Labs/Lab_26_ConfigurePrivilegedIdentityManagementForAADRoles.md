## Exercise 2 - PIM with Microsoft Entra ID roles

### Task 1 - Assign a role

With Microsoft Entra ID, a Global administrator can make permanent Microsoft Entra ID admin role assignments. These role assignments can be created using the Azure portal or using PowerShell commands.

The Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM) service also allows Privileged role administrators to make permanent admin role assignments. Additionally, Privileged role administrators can make users eligible for Microsoft Entra ID admin roles. An eligible administrator can activate the role when they need it, and then their permissions expire once they're done.

Follow these steps to make a user eligible for an Azure AD admin role.

1. Search for and then select **Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management.**

2. In the Privileged Identity Management page, in the left navigation, select **Microsoft Entra roles.**

3. On the Quick start page, in the left navigation, under Manage select **Roles (1)**.

4. On the top menu, select **+ Add assignments (2)**

    ![Screen image displaying Azure AD roles with Add assignments menu highlighted](./media/aroll.png)

5. In the Add assignments page, on the **Membership** tab, review the settings.

6. Select the **Select role** menu and then select **Compliance Administrator**.

7. You can use the **Search role by name** filter to help locate a role.

8. Under **Select member(s),** select **No member selected**.

9. In the Select a member pane, select **Miriam Graham** and then select **Select**.

   ![Screen image displaying the select a member pane with a selected member highlighted](./media/miriam12345.png)

11. On the **Settings** tab, under **Assignment type**, review the available options. For this task, use the default setting.

    - Eligible assignments require the member of the role to perform an action to use the role. Actions might include performing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) check, providing a business justification, or requesting approval from designated approvers.
    - Active assignments do not require the member to perform any action to use the role. Members assigned as active have the privileges always assigned to the role.

12. Review the remaining settings and then select **Assign**.

### Task 2 - Log in with Miriam
